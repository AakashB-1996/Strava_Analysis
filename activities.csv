Alright, so here’s a short review for the gels I used today
Carbs fuel - 50g carbs but almost like a fruit juice, very liquidy and easy to consume on the go, almost made me feel full and good to go for an hour without needing any other input! Definitely adding this to my go to gel for the next cycle
E.Gel - Very similar texture to Gu, but definitely not as sweet as it! Loved the taste profile but will have to try it again and it would take some getting used to! Loved the Sodium content in it though! Not sure if I will add it to my list yet but may be after 1-2 more attempts, I will get a better idea!
Mango BPN - went expecting to hate it so probably that helped😂 didn’t have any issues with it but if I’m using this gel, it would be towards the back end in the closing stages where the excitement of getting to the finish line will also be there in my system! Again, not sure if I will add this to my gel cycle, I may prefer having sis over this!",9168,19.33,172.0,267,false,,Saucony Triumph 21 Eazzzzzzzzyyyy,activities/12607998129.fit.gz,,,9168.0,7873.0,19337.599609375,3.700000047683716,2.4561920166015625,54.0,80.0,195.0,225.0,10.0,-0.13445308804512024,,,92.0,85.99372863769531,172.0,161.04983520507812,,187.6184539794922,1836.0,,,267.0,,,,,,,,,182.0,8649.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,19704.80078125,1720259968.0,1.0,21.81999969482422,22.59000015258789,17.399999618530273,0.7599999904632568,1015.1199951171875,2.680000066757202,4.71999979019165,30.0,0.0,1720265088.0,1720316416.0,0.0,,17719904.0,0.5299999713897705,5.0,0.0,25455.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,2.1092495918273926,240.0,,,,22628.0,,,450.0,137.0,2.5028324127197266,,,media/819BC913-B211-440D-A74D-CA3ED0A3AB79.jpg
